## ðŸ“Š Project Overview
This project implements various regression models to analyze, predict, and forecast Bitcoin prices using historical market data from January 2017 to July 2021. The goal is to build machine learning models that can accurately predict Bitcoin prices and provide insights into price trends and volatility patterns.
The dataset contains daily Bitcoin market data with the following features:
## ðŸŽ¯ Project Objectives
Price Prediction: Develop regression models to predict Bitcoin closing prices

Trend Analysis: Identify patterns and correlations in price movements

Feature Engineering: Create meaningful technical indicators and time-based features

Model Comparison: Evaluate multiple regression algorithms for performance

Price Forecasting: Generate short-term future price predictions

## Date: Daily timestamp (1/1/2017 - 5/30/2025)

* Close: Daily closing price (USD)

* High: Daily highest price (USD)

* Low: Daily lowest price (USD)

* Open: Daily opening price (USD)

* Volume: Daily trading volume
## Models Implemented
1. Linear Regression - Baseline model

2. Ridge Regression - L2 regularization

3. Lasso Regression - L1 regularization with feature selection

4. Random Forest Regressor - Ensemble tree-based method

5. Gradient Boosting Regressor - Sequential ensemble learning
